camt: a shitty cat copy

This is a shitty cat copy that did to prove my knowlegde and see where 
I could get better.

It takes a quick glance at the source code to see that I'm a beginner :D

#Build instructions

This is a particularly simple program with a particularly simple compilation
just use 

gcc -o camt camt.h camt.c

and you should be fine since this only standard libraries.
